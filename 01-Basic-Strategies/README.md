### üìä [MovingAverageCrossover.mq5](./MovingAverageCrossover.mq5)
**Classic dual moving average crossover strategy for trend identification**

**üìà Complete Strategy Explanation:**

**What are Moving Averages?** Moving averages smooth out price data to identify trend direction. This strategy uses two MAs:
- **Fast MA**: 20-period SMA (reacts quickly to price changes)
- **Slow MA**: 200-period SMA (shows long-term trend)

**Trading Logic:**
1. **Bullish Crossover**: Fast MA crosses ABOVE slow MA ‚Üí Enter LONG (BUY)
2. **Bearish Crossover**: Fast MA crosses BELOW slow MA ‚Üí Enter SHORT (SELL)
3. **New Bar Execution**: Only checks for signals when a new bar forms (not on every tick)

**Risk Management:**
- **Fixed Stop Loss**: 100 points from entry price
- **Fixed Take Profit**: 100 points from entry price
- **Magic Number**: 20250824 (to identify this EA's trades)

**Key Learning Points:**
- Moving average indicator integration (`iMA`)
- Crossover detection logic
- New bar detection technique (`static datetime`)
- Market order placement with SL/TP
- Array handling and series ordering
- Professional error handling and logging

**Parameters:**
- Fast MA: 20 periods (customizable in code)
- Slow MA: 200 periods (customizable in code)
- Fixed lot size: 0.01
- SL/TP distance: 100 points

**Use Case:** Perfect introduction to trend-following strategies and indicator-based trading

### üìè [ATRPositionSizing.mq5](./ATRPositionSizing.mq5)
**Advanced ATR-based trading strategy with volatility-adaptive entries**

**üìä Complete Strategy Explanation:**

**What is ATR?** Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures market volatility by calculating the average of the last N candles' true ranges.

**How ATR Behaves:**
- When recent candles are small ‚Üí ATR value decreases  
- When candles become bigger ‚Üí ATR value increases
- ATR adapts to current market volatility conditions

**Trading Logic:**
1. **Compare** each candle's size to its corresponding ATR value
2. **Trigger Condition**: When a candle is X times bigger than the ATR value
3. **Entry Direction**: Enter in the direction of the large "trigger candle"
   - Big red candle (bearish) ‚Üí Enter SHORT
   - Big green candle (bullish) ‚Üí Enter LONG

**Example:** After a big bearish candle that's significantly larger than ATR, the trend often continues downward, making it a good short entry signal.

**Key Learning Points:**
- Technical indicator integration (ATR calculation)
- Volatility-based entry signals
- Momentum and trend-following concepts
- Dynamic market adaptation
- Professional trading strategy structure

**Parameters:**
- ATR period (N candles for calculation)
- Multiplier threshold (X times ATR)
- Position sizing based on volatility
- Risk management integration
